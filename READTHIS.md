This is the README markdown for the Dissertation submitted to the University of Stirling on 09/04/2025. The PyRisk framework is not my own, it has been built entirely by Chronitis on GitHub. For its full details, please refer to the other README. This dissertation revolves around the development of an RL model, which can be found in the ai folder under the name of Skynet. The following command can be run in the terminal to play Skynet against AIAI for 5000 games, which should be enough to observe a marked improvement if you wish to see it 
python -m pyrisk SkynetAI AlAI --games=5000
